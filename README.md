# Project HOMELAND
Project Homeland is a Unreal Engine 4 game being worked on by [Swappt Org.](https://github.com/swappt).

## Project HOMELAND 2D
HOMELAND 2D is the 2D port of HOMELAND, being developed by the [lead developer](https://github.com/jellywx) at Swappt. Instead of using Unreal Engine 4, it will use Kivy 1.10.0, making it possible for mobile and desktop devices.

HOMELAND 2D may also support more features than the actual HOMELAND may, at a poorer graphical quality.
